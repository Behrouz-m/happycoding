 72. Edit Distance
 
 Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)
 
 You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
 
 a) Insert a character
 b) Delete a character
 c) Replace a character

 Wagnerâ€“Fischer algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm
 Levenshtein distance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
 
 Given len(word1) = N and len(word2) = M, WF algorithm takes O(M*N) time and O(N) space. Original algorithm takes
 O(M*N) space (the entir matrix) as well. By a closer look, we only need keep the previous row. Then further narrow the
 previous row to 2 extra variables to track the upper left and "current" values on the previous row.
