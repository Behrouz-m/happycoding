72. Edit Distance

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance

Wagnerâ€“Fischer algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm
Levenshtein distance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance

Given len(word1) = N and len(word2) = M, WF algorithm takes O(M*N) time and O(N) space. Original algorithm takes
O(M*N) space (the entir matrix) as well. By a closer look, we only need keep the previous row. We need 2 extra variables to track the upper left and "current" values on the previous row.

Comparing with LCS, this one has 3 picky edge cases due to the way we grab previous result.

1. 0 == j:

Since the current min at given [i, j] is decided by memo[j], memo[j - 1] and previous upperleft value (old memo[j - 1]), we have
an edge case when i = 0 (if we do NOT want to have extra code in the inner loop to handle it and instead seeking for an universal form)

The universal form:

- If word1[j] == word2[i], then memo[j + 1] = previous upperleft;
- If word1[j] != word2[i], then memo[j + 1] = MIN(previous upperleft, memo[j], memo[j + 1]) + 1

For the edge case at word1[0]:

- If word1[0] == word2[i], then memo[1] = memo[1] (previous row);
- If word1[0] != word2[i], then memo[1] = memo[1] (previous row) + 1;

Therefore, in order to keep the universal form, we have to make sure that previous upperleft and memo[0] is always no less than memo[1] (previous row)
when i = 0. This is done by:

ul = memo[0], memo[0] = i + 1; //if i starts from 0

Frist one makes sure memo[1] = previous upperleft is still intact when word1[0] == word2[j];
Second one makes sure memo[0] is no less than memo[1] (previous row);

2. Either of two strings is empty:

Fortunately, the arrangement for edage case 1 could cover edge case 2 as well!

3. 0 == i:

In this case, specifically,

When word1[j] != word2[0], then memo[j + 1] = MIN(previous upperleft, memo[j], memo[j + 1]) + 1

The previous result, for this case, the initialized state of memo will impact the result (previous upperleft and memo[j + 1], memo[j] as well when i = 0).

This is handled by:

std::iota(memo.begin(), memo.end(), 0);

This plus the handling of edge case 1 together will make sure memo[j] is always picked when i = 0.
